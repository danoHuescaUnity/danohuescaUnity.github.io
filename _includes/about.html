        <p>I’m <strong>Luis Huesca</strong>, a Senior Unity Game Developer specialized in mobile games.
          I’ve spent the last years designing, building and shipping features for 2D and 3D titles:
          from gameplay systems and UI flows to tools that make the whole team faster and more consistent.</p>

        <p>I enjoy taking ownership of features from prototype to production: breaking down problems,
          writing clean and maintainable C# code, profiling and optimizing where it matters, and
          iterating quickly based on player data and team feedback. I’m used to working remotely,
          collaborating with multidisciplinary teams, and balancing fun, usability and monetization. </p>
