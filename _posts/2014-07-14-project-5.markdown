description:
  "Broken Gods is an online multiplayer VR shooter built around in-house hardware,
  including a custom treadmill locomotion system and proprietary VR rifles.
  As a Unity Developer and acting project lead/PM,
  I translated ambitious creative and technical goals into a shippable plan: defining scope,
  setting priorities, and managing timelines while implementing key VR gameplay systems.
  My work focused on ensuring the experience felt responsive, immersive,
  and production-feasible across a complex stack of networking + bespoke devices."
highlights:
  - "Implemented core VR gameplay interactions and shooter mechanics, aligning feel and responsiveness with the custom rifle controllers."
  - "Supported integration and iteration with in-house hardware (treadmill locomotion + proprietary peripherals), balancing immersion, comfort, and technical constraints."
  - "Contributed to multiplayer/online gameplay implementation and testing, focusing on stability and consistent player experience."
  - "Owned scope and prioritization: translating ideas into feasible milestones, cutting/adjusting features when needed, and keeping delivery on track."
  - "Coordinated closely with creatives and engineers to align vision, timelines, and technical execution."
