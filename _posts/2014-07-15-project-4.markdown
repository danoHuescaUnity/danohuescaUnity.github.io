description: "As a Unity Developer (and acting as a lightweight project lead/PM), I helped bring TrueDown to life: a VR horror narrative set in an abandoned building where a ritual went wrong. I translated creative intent into shippable VR gameplay by defining what was feasible, prioritizing scope, and implementing the core interactive moments—combining VR interactions, in-world animations, and VFX to deliver tension, pacing, and immersion across headsets."
highlights:
  - "Implemented VR interactions (object handling, in-world triggers, and player-driven moments) to suppor the narrative flow."
  - "Built and integrated animations to reinforce story beats and environmental storytelling"
  - "Created and tuned VFX for horror atmosphere and key “ritual” moments, focusing on presence and timing."
  - "Took ownership of technical decision-making: scoping features, cutting/adjusting ideas based on feasibility, and aligning execution with creative goals."
  - "Supported iteration with creatives by rapidly prototyping interactions and polishing the experience for headset comfort and immersion."
