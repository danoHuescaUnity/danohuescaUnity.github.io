description: "As a Unity Developer, I owned the end-to-end delivery of a Bingo mini-game inside Slotsburg: from core gameplay implementation and game data handling (balls, state, progression/rewards) to defining and polishing the UI animations and VFX that make the moment-to-moment experience feel satisfying. I worked across gameplay, presentation, and integration to ship a cohesive feature that fits seamlessly within the main game loop."
highlights:
  - "Implemented the full Bingo gameplay loop (earning balls, drawing/using balls, matching numbers, and completing Bingo states)."
  - "Managed and integrated game data/state required to play reliably (session flow, ball tracking, win conditions, and rewards hooks)."
  - "Designed and implemented UI animation beats to improve clarity, feedback, and perceived polish."
  - "Created and integrated VFX to reinforce key moments (ball acquisition, matches, and Bingo completion)."
  - "Ensured the mini-game felt consistent with the host game’s UX and pacing through iteration and tuning."
