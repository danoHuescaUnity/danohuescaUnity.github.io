description: As a Senior Unity Developer, I supported a large-scale live game by delivering seasonal live-ops events and polish-focused improvements: from implementing event logic and currency/data handling to crafting UI animations, VFX, and running A/B tests to validate iterations. I also improved overall stability by fixing production bugs and elevating visual quality to make the experience feel more refined and cohesive.
highlights:
 -Implemented and maintained seasonal live-ops events, including event flow logic and content updates.
 -Built UI animations and integrated VFX to improve feedback, clarity, and overall presentation.
 -Worked with currency and economy-related data, ensuring consistency and reliability across features.
 -Supported A/B testing to evaluate variations and iterate quickly based on results.
 -Fixed bugs and delivered visual polish improvements to enhance perceived quality and reduce friction.
 -Collaborated closely with designers, 2D artists, and backend developers to ship features smoothly.
